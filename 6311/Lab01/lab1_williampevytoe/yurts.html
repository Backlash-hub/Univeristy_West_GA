            <dt><strong>What is a yurk?</strong></dt> 
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurks finished?</strong></dt> 
            <dd>Each yurt is finished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table, and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt> 
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It’s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
