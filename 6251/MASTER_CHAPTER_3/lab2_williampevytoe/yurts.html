                <dt>What is a yurk?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a
                    wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>
                <dt>How are the yurks finished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is finished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining
                    table, and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes
                    a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing. It’s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
